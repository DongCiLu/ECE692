\begin{abstract}
Understanding the underlying attitude of people towards a given image automatically is important for many applications. The rapid growth of social media provides new opportunities and challenges to design image sentiment inference systems. Due to the weak relation between low-level visual features and sentiment, recent work focus on constructing mid-level semantic representation that can both be easily detected from the input images and be mapped to the sentiment class. However, ... We propose a novel convolution network based end to end system that can automatically generate the most suitable mid-level features. We show the effectiveness of our approaches by detecting sentiment of image tweets and show significant improvement against baseline approaches.
